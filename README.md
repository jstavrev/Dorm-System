About us:

This project is created for educational purposes. It's purpose is allowing users to register sensors to already existing sensor systems.
This will allow them to monitor the sensor reading real-time and get notified if a sensor sends data outside the predefined by the user criteria.

Users can see reports with more detailed information about the Sensor such as:
Location
Min/Max acceptable values
Update Interval

Admins have the following access:
Manage sensors - Register and modify other user's sensors
Manage user - Change user details and assign roles.
Manage base sensors - See detailed information for the available sensor options.
